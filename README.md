Hey There, am Jayesh Seth (Mad Flasher), am a software developer with specialization in mobile app development. I always like to try new and different things with special love for Android ðŸ’š. I am self taught developer as a result i prefer sharing everything i learn in whatever way possible (usually blogs and talks and apps).

# navigate thur my github
I like to keep things clean and organised thus have fixed repos and projects so to help you navigate thru my github below are the primary projects i try to be consistant and maintain.

rest of the projects (still important) can be found here.

- [**Madifiers**](https://github.com/MadFlasheroo7/Madifiers) - Madifiers are a bunch of pre-made modifiers (get it?), composables, extension functions and so on with an aim to make development with Jetpack Compose easier and more straightforward. (or thats the goal atleastðŸ™ƒ)
